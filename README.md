This repo provides an Angular SPA that interacts with a Rest API build using ASP.Net Core to Create and Search Retrospectives.

Valdiation is done in a very basic way, but it can be made better with time.

## Backend :

Back end is a .net app so first this needs to run and it should run at https://localhost:7118/swagger/index.html and show the swagger API documentation.

For the time being, I did do only one test case, but these can be improved and expanded to other test cases.

## Frontend: 

You may want to update the node packages by running `npm install`

This project will run using `ng serve -o` and should open the SPA at port http://localhost:4200/
