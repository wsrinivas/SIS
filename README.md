This repo provides an Angular SPA that interacts with a Rest API build using ASP.Net Core to Create and Search Retrospectives.

Sorry I did not do any test cases, as there was no time, as I picked this task only today 

##Backend :

Back end is a .net app so first this needs to run and it should run at https://localhost:7118/swagger/index.html and show the swagger API documentation.


##Frontend: 

You may want to update the node packages by running `npm install`
This project can be run using `ng serve -o` and should open the app at port http://localhost:4200/


Sorry the Add Feedback is not working as there is a problem with the parent child relationship but if I have more time I can fix these issues.
